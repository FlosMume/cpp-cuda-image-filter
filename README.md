# 🧩 C++ CUDA Image Filter (Windows + WSL2)

A minimal, production-ready CUDA C++ starter project for learning and testing GPU kernels in **Windows + WSL2** environments.  
Designed for reproducible builds, clean debugging, and automated testing.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- CUDA C++ example: `src/image_filter.cu`
- Cross-platform build via **CMake**
- GPU architecture targeting (Compute Capability **8.9**, RTX 4070 SUPER)
- `.vscode/launch.json` for GDB debugging
- `CTest` integration for regression testing
- `check_cuda_starter_status.sh` for device info + benchmark

## 🧱 Project Structure
```
cuda-starter-windows-wsl/
├── src/
│   └── image_filter.cu
├── build/                # Auto-generated by CMake
├── .vscode/              # VS Code launch configuration
├── .gitignore
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── check_cuda_starter_status.sh
└── README.md
```

## ⚙️ Build & Run

From project root:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/image_filter
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Center value after blur: 0.040000 (expected ~0.04)
Success!
```

---

## 🧪 Testing with CTest
Run the integrated test target:

```bash
cd build
ctest
```

Expected:
```
Test project /path/to/build

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1
```

---

## ⚡ Status Check Script
A helper script validates your CUDA environment and runs a quick benchmark.

```bash
./check_cuda_starter_status.sh
```

Typical output:
```
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER (Compute Capability 8.9)
Driver Version: 560.xx, CUDA 12.8
Vector Add completed in 0.5 ms
```

---

## 🧠 Environment
| Component | Recommended Version |
|------------|--------------------|
| CUDA Toolkit | 12.8+ |
| CMake | ≥ 3.24 |
| Compiler | `g++` or `nvcc` |
| GPU | RTX 4070 SUPER (SM 8.9) |
| OS | Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04) |

---

## 🛠 VS Code Integration
Launch configuration is in `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Run image_filter",
  "type": "cppdbg",
  "request": "launch",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/image_filter",
  "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
  "MIMode": "gdb"
}
```
Run or debug directly with **F5** inside VS Code.
